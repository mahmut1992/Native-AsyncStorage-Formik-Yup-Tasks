## 📝 Project Purpose

This project showcases how to build a professional mobile app combining **local storage** and **dynamic form validation**.  
Think of it like a smart notepad 📓: you write your tasks, and even if you close the app or restart the phone, your notes are kept safe — thanks to AsyncStorage acting like an invisible locker. 🔒

It also demonstrates how Formik and Yup can simplify form management, much like having a personal assistant that checks every form field before letting it pass! ✅
